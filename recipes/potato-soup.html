        <h3>Descriptions</h3>
        <p>I have made this for many whom have given it the title. This takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
            <li>Cook celery and onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
        </ol>
